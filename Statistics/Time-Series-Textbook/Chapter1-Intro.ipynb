    "\n",
    "There are four components.\n",
    "1. Trend\n",
    "2. Cycle\n",
    "3. Seasonal variations\n",
    "4. Irregular fluctuations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Trend\n",
    "Is the upward or downward movement that characterizes a time series over a perios of time. Reflects the long-run growth or decline in a time series. It can represent a lot of factors, a lot of things can sum to result in a trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cycle\n",
    "The recurring up and down movement around trend levels. These can have long durations or short durations.\n",
    "\n",
    "One example is the business cycle. This is a fluxuation in the time series caused by recurrent periods of prosperity alternating with recession. Not all are economic caused. Can be weather cycles, clothing styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because there is no single explanation for cyclical flucuations, they vary greatly in length and magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Seasonal Variations\n",
    "Periodic patterns in a time series that complete within one year and occur every year. Hence, seasonal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example, when people sign their lease. Mostly summer, because people don't like moving in the winter. Various holidays can cause a store to shut down resulting in less sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Irregular Fluctuations\n",
    "Erratic movements that follow no recognizable pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`Time series can occur with one or some or all of the above integrated. So, no single best forecasting model exists. So, the most important problem to solve with forecasting is to match the appropriate forecasting model to the pattern of the available time series data.`"

    "## Qualitative Forecasting Methods / Judgemental Forecasting\n",
    "Use the opinions of experts to predict future events subjectively. Used when historical data is either not available or scarce. Example, if a company is introducing a new product. There is no historical data to judge how it will do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also used to predict changes in historical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subjective Curve Fitting\n",
    "Considering the product lifecycle (growth, maturity, decline), you can construct an S-curve to forecast sales, representing the cycle. Data on other products can be used to help make this.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the biggest problems here is deciding the shape of the curve. (log?, exponentional?, some weird poly?)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Delphi Method\n",
    "A panel of experts is used to produce predictions concerning a specific question. This assumes the respondants are experts in the field and that the combined knowledge will be at least as good as a single member. Participants are physically seperated to help remove bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method does not require that a consensus is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time-Independent Technological Comparison\n",
    "Changes in one area are predicted by monitoring changes that take place in another area. Is often used to predict technology change.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, forecaster tries to determine a pattern of change in one area (the **primary change**) which they believe will result in changes in a different area.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example, a new metal company thinks that if NASA starts using the metal more, it's common use will also grow in a lapsed fashion. So, they monitor that.\n",
    "\n",
    "This has two main problems.\n",
    "1. A primary trend must be identified\n",
    "2. Expertise must be used to find a precise relationship between primary and event to be forecasted."

    "### Univariate Models\n",
    "Predict future values of a time series based solely on past values. They are useful when conditions are expected to remain the same, but not useful for forecasting management policy changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Causal Models\n",
    "Involves identifying other variables that are related to the variable to be predicted. Once found, a statistical model that describes the relationship betweem these variables and the variable to be forecasted is developed. Then, the statistical relationship derived is used to forecast the variable of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example, sales of a product might be related to price, advertising, substitutes, etc. Here, sales is the **dependent variable** and everything else are **independent variables**. Or y and the x's.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once there is a statistical estimate of the relationship between dependent and independents, forecaster uses predicted future values of the independent variables to predict the future value of sales.\n",

    "# 1.3 Errors in Forecasting  \n",
    "Some error is going to happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Irregular Component** - Represents unexplained or unpredictable fluxuations in the data. If the effect of it is substantial, then it will be hard to forecast. However, it is not the only source of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The accuracy of our prediction also infuences the magnitude of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Errors in forecasting are combined irregular and inaccuracies in predictions. So, large errors for either one can mean that the forecasting is going to hurt and that technique will not be able to accurately predict the trend, seasonal and cyclical components and should be discarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Forecasts\n",
    "In book, there are two:\n",
    "* Point Forecast\n",
    " * A single number that represents the best prediction of actual\n",
    "* Prediction Interval Forecast\n",
    " * Interval of numbers representing confidence (confidence interval)\n",

    "## Measuring Forecast Errors\n",

    "$$\\textbf{y_t} == actual$$  \n",
    "$$\\hat{y}_t == predicted$$  \n",
    "$$e_t = y_t - \\hat{y}_t == forecast_error $$\n",
    "\n",
    "If the forecasting technique is accurately forecasting the components of the time series, forecast errors should only be present in the irregeular component and thus they should appear purely random. Them being random does not automatically mean that the forecast is good though.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, when the forecasting technique is wrong, you can tell by the forecasting error having a pattern over time. So, if didn't account of a trend, the forecasting errors may have a trend, and for other components.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Absolute Deviation** $= |e_t| = |y_t - \\hat{y}_t|$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)** $= \\frac{\\sum_{t=1}^n |e_t|}{n} = \\frac{\\sum_{t=1}^n |y_t - \\hat{y}_t|}{n}$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Squared Error** $= (e_t)^2 = (y_t - \\hat{y}_t)^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mean Squared Error (MSE)** $= \\frac{\\sum_{t=1}^n (e_t)^2}{n} = \\frac{\\sum_{t=1}^n (y_t - \\hat{y}_t)^2}{n}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Both MSE and MAD can be used to measure the magnitude of forecast errors. They are different in that:\n",
    "* MSE penalizes a forecasting technique much more for large errors than small\n",
    "* MAD just shows the error in the scale it occured.\n",
    "\n",
    "What you want to use depends on if you want to punish large errors more or them being large is enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "Magnitude error measures like MAD and MSE can be used two ways\n",
    "1. Aid in selecting a forecasting model. Go with the one with lowest error magnitudes through train-test.\n",
    "2. Used to monitor a forecasting system in order to detect when something has \"gone wrong\". If measures suddenly shoot up, is an alert that are forecastng is no longer working and something drastic may have happened.\n",

    "To measure forecasting error that you can compare across different times series of different scale, turn them into percents.\n",
