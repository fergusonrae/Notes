# Goal

To create an organized library of notes taken on various different topics, but mostly regarding computer science, math, and machine learning.

# Why?

I find that I learn best if I take the time to jot down notes as I learn about concepts. In my day-to-day work I am constantly reading up on and researching new topics and software that I need to become proficient with quickly. Taking notes helps me retain the information along with the memory that I had read up about it at all when I desperately need the information a couple of months later. Also, I find that reading notes written in my own manner of talking is easier to scan and absorb, great for referencing when I run into problems concerning the topic.

# How To Use

All notes can be opened directly in the browser through navigating to it in GitHub. Or, if you'd prefer to open them locally or run code contained in them, there are options depending on the file type.

## Markdown Files (.md)

To edit, my favorite program is Typora which is a free download and is great for seamless typing transition in markdown.

## Jupyter Notebooks

As a heads up, pretty few of these notebooks contain runable code, so choosing right out the bat to download conda to run them might not be worth it!

To edit and run code locally, clone the repo and download either Anaconda or, if you're less willing to commit a large portion of ram, Miniconda. Both of these programs come with Jupyter Notebooks. Then, from the root directory, open the command line/terminal and run:

`jupyter notebook`

to open the Jupyter Notebook Program. You can then navigate to the notebook and select it to open.

Alternatively, if you don't want to download any programs to run python code, you can bind the notebook using mybinder. (https://mybinder.org/). After navigating to the site, use the clone link of this repo as the GitHub repo name, keep the branch at master, and optionally select the notebook you want to open (which will speed up the binding). Then, once the notebooks are bound, Jupyter Notebooks will open in your browser and you will be able to navigate to and run the notebook.
