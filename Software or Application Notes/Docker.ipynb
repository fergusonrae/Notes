    "# Containers vs Virutal Machines\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtual machines run operating systems. So, if the VM is a Windows, it will run Windows on the new computer which is very resource intensive. A Docker shares a single kernel which only has information regarding the executable and its package dependencies which are not installed on the host system. These run natively and, since they contain all of their dependencies, they can run anywhere\n",
