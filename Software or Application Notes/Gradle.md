# Gradle

## Overview

Automates builds by defining a list of commands based on installed packages and coding language. So, it supports the automatic download and configuartion of dependencies.

### Projects and Tasks

A Gradle build has one or more projects. **Projects** are something that should be built or done. Each project consists of tasks. A **task** is a piece of work that the build performs.

A project describes its build via a build.gradle file which is located at the root folder of the project.

### Plug-ins

A **plug-in** is an extension to Gradle which typically adds some preconfigured tasks.
